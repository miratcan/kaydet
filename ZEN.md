# The Zen of `kaydet`

## Experience

* `kaydet` stores work, ideas, observations, and lived moments (sometimes even invoices). Leaving a note in `kaydet` is as natural as breathing.
* `kaydet` has a low learning curve: it doesn't present itself as something to be learned; learning happens naturally over time.
* `kaydet` can be a simple note-taking tool, or it can be used as a rich information system. The choice is the user's; consistent experience is the application's job.
* Except for irreversible actions like deletion, `kaydet` doesn’t ask for additional confirmation or input from the user.

## Data

* At its core, `kaydet` is a plain text file-based tool. Tools come and go, lines remain.
* `kaydet` records must remain readable by both humans and machines.
* `kaydet` does not require an internet connection.
* `kaydet` can repair itself.

## Tools

* `kaydet` is a batteries-included tool. Except for edge cases, it doesn’t rely on external helpers.

## Evolution

* `kaydet` doesn’t cling to the past. It doesn’t carry the burden of backward compatibility. Change requires courage—and draws its strength from a small but free user base.

## Discipline

* `kaydet` may encourage good habits through suggestions, but it doesn’t enforce discipline. (e.g., “back up your notes,” “you have too many tags”)

## Intelligence

* In `kaydet`, AI is not just a reader but a fully authorized participant; whatever the CLI can do, the MCP can do too.
