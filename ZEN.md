# The Zen of `kaydet`

## Experience

* **[ZEN-NATURAL]:** `kaydet` stores work, ideas, observations, and lived moments (sometimes even invoices). Leaving a note in `kaydet` is as natural as breathing.
* **[ZEN-INTUITIVE]:** `kaydet` has a low learning curve: it doesn't present itself as something to be learned; learning happens naturally over time.
* **[ZEN-USER-CHOICE]:** `kaydet` can be a simple note-taking tool, or it can be used as a rich information system. The choice is the user's; consistent experience is the application's job.
* **[ZEN-NO-CONFIRMATION]:** `kaydet` doesn't ask for confirmation except for irreversible actions like deletion.

## Data

* **[ZEN-PLAIN-TEXT]:** `kaydet` is fundamentally a plain text file-based tool. Tools come and go, lines remain.
* **[ZEN-READABLE]:** `kaydet` records must remain readable by both humans and machines.
* **[ZEN-OFFLINE]:** `kaydet` does not require an internet connection.
* **[ZEN-SELF-HEAL]:** `kaydet` detects and repairs data inconsistencies automatically.

## Tools

* **[ZEN-STANDALONE]:** `kaydet` is batteries-included and works out of the box.

## Evolution

* **[ZEN-COURAGE]:** `kaydet` doesn't cling to the past. It doesn't carry the burden of backward compatibility. Breaking changes are acceptable when documented in CHANGELOG; stability will grow with the user base.

## Discipline

* **[ZEN-SUGGEST-NOT-ENFORCE]:** `kaydet` may encourage good habits through suggestions, but it doesn't enforce discipline. (e.g., "back up your notes," "you have too many tags")

## Intelligence

* **[ZEN-AI-PARITY]:** `kaydet` treats AI as a fully authorized participant, not just a reader; whatever the CLI can do, the MCP (Model Context Protocol) can do too.
