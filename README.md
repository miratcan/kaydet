> üöÄ **Ultra-fast command-line diary** | üì¶ **Plain text, zero lock-in** | üè∑Ô∏è **Smart tagging** | ü§ñ **AI-ready**

Kaydet is a lightweight command-line diary that keeps your daily thoughts in
plain text files on your own machine. It is designed to disappear into your
workflow: invoke it for a quick note, drop into your editor for longer
reflections, or pop open the archive folder when you feel nostalgic.

## Use Cases

Kaydet's structured metadata, hashtagging, and instant search make it useful far beyond a basic diary.

### üíº Work Log & Git Notes
Keep a running changelog for your projects. Add metadata for commits, PRs, or status updates so you can pivot on them later.

```bash
kaydet "Fixed staging authentication bug" commit:38edf60 pr:76 status:done time:2h
kaydet "Reviewed onboarding flow copy" status:wip project:kaydet

# Later
kaydet search commit:38edf60
kaydet search "status:done project:kaydet"
```

### üìö Personal Knowledge Base (Today I Learned)
Capture commands, code snippets, or references and tag them for future discovery.

```bash
kaydet "TIL: `pytest --cov-report=html` generates a browsable coverage report." topic:testing stack:python #til
kaydet search "topic:testing"
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Energy Tracking
Structure your day with explicit durations or effort levels and surface them with numeric searches.

```bash
kaydet "Deep work on analytics ETL" time:2.5h intensity:high project:valocom
kaydet "Pairing session with Emre" time:1.5h intensity:medium project:kaydet

# Find the long sessions
kaydet search "time:>2"
```

### üí° Idea & Research Log
Jot down ideas or research findings along with context, so you can filter them when planning.

```bash
kaydet "Prototype encrypted export flow" area:security priority:high #idea
kaydet "Read Stripe's migration playbook" area:payments source:stripe-docs #research

kaydet search "area:security"
```

### üòä Mood & Wellness Journal
Track your wellbeing with tags and metadata that make reflective searches easy.

```bash
kaydet "Morning run felt amazing" mood:energized sleep:7h #wellness
kaydet "Afternoon slump before standup" mood:tired caffeine:2 cups #mood

kaydet search "mood:energized"
```

### üí∞ Lightweight Expense Tracker
Log expenses on the go with structured fields you can later parse or export.

```bash
kaydet "Lunch with client" amount:650 currency:TRY client:bbrain billable:yes #expense
kaydet "Domain renewal" amount:120 currency:USD project:kaydet billable:no

kaydet search "billable:yes"
```

## Highlights
- **Terminal native** ‚Äì stays in your shell and respects your configured editor.
- **Own your data** ‚Äì simple timestamped text files, perfect for syncing however you like.
- **Configurable** ‚Äì adjust file naming, headings, the editor command, and storage location.
- **Gentle reminders** ‚Äì optional nudge when you have not written anything for a while.
- **Cross-platform** ‚Äì works anywhere Python 3.8+ runs.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Append a short entry to today's file
kaydet "Made progress on the side project."

# Add inline hashtags to categorize an entry
kaydet "Dinner with friends #family #gratitude"

# Drop into your favourite editor for a longer note
kaydet --editor

# Open the folder that keeps all diary files
kaydet --folder

# Quick tag & metadata housekeeping
kaydet --tags            # list tags from the index
kaydet --doctor          # rebuild the search index

# Search past entries for a word or tag fragment
kaydet --search gratitude
kaydet --search "status:done"
kaydet --search "time:>1"

# Update or remove past entries by ID (IDs are shown in search results)
kaydet --edit 42
kaydet --delete 42 --yes  # skip confirmation prompts
```

Example `kaydet --stats` output:

```
September 2025
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
 1[  ]  2[  ]  3[  ]  4[  ]  5[  ]  6[  ]  7[  ]
 8[  ]  9[  ] 10[  ] 11[  ] 12[  ] 13[  ] 14[  ]
...
Total entries this month: 12
```

Each entry is written to a daily file (for example `~/.kaydet/2024-02-19.txt`)
and prefixed with the current time plus a durable numeric identifier:

```
14:25 [132]: Finished refactoring the sync helper #focus
```

Opening an existing daily file will append a new section; the first entry of the
day creates the file with a heading for easy navigating. Kaydet keeps those
files and the SQLite index in sync automatically‚Äîany command that touches the
database refreshes changed files, assigns missing IDs, and lets you know when a
file was rewritten.

Add inline hashtags (for example `#family`) or structured metadata (`project:valocom`,
`time:45m`) to enrich your notes. Kaydet stores everything in the daily file,
indexes it for instant search, lists tags with `kaydet --tags`, and rebuilds the
index with `kaydet --doctor`. The `kaydet --folder` command opens your main log
directory so you can browse or sync the raw files whenever you like.

## Configuration
Kaydet stores its settings in `~/.config/kaydet/config.ini` (or the location
pointed to by `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). The file is created on first run and you can
change any of the values. A minimal example:

```ini
[SETTINGS]
DAY_FILE_PATTERN = %Y-%m-%d.txt
DAY_TITLE_PATTERN = %Y/%m/%d - %A
LOG_DIR = /Users/you/.kaydet
EDITOR = nvim
```

- `DAY_FILE_PATTERN` controls the diary file name.
- `DAY_TITLE_PATTERN` sets the heading written at the top of new files.
- `LOG_DIR` points to the directory where entries live.
- `EDITOR` is the command Kaydet runs for long-form entries (`--editor`).

Any edits take effect the next time you invoke Kaydet.

## Reminders
Want a heads-up if you have not logged anything lately? Add the reminder flag to
your shell startup (for example in `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
kaydet --reminder
```

When the last entry is older than two hours Kaydet prints:

```
It's been over two hours since your last Kaydet entry. Capture what you've been up to with `kaydet --editor`.
```
